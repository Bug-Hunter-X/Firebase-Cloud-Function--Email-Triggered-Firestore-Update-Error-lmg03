# Firebase Cloud Function: Email-Triggered Firestore Update

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Cloud Functions when handling email-triggered updates to Firestore. The initial code lacks robust error handling and makes assumptions about the structure of incoming email data.  The solution provides a more resilient implementation.

## Bug Description
The original function fails to handle cases where the email data is missing or malformed, leading to unexpected behavior or function crashes.  It does not properly validate the data before updating the Firestore document.

## Solution
The solution introduces comprehensive error handling and input validation. It checks for the existence of required email fields and handles potential exceptions during the Firestore update operation.  Logging and detailed error messages enhance debugging capabilities.
